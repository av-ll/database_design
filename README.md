# database_design

University project mysql project with Max 20 table constraint

There is a PDF with the database design as well as the code used to generate and populate the database in 2 separate text files.


Instructions

In order to "install" the database on your computer you will have 2 options.
The first one is to simply open a terminal or command line and opening mysql.
Create a database named Airbnb or something else using the command "CREATE DATABASE mysql; for example.
After this you can use the dump file airbnb.sql.
To use this file, run this on a terminal 'mysql airbnb < airbnb.sql'. 
After this your new database will have all the contents of my airbnb database.
If this way is not convenient for you there are also 2 other files you can use to create the database on your side.
There are 2 txt files named 'Createdatabasetablescommands' and 'load_csv_files_into_tables_on_terminal_commands'.
These 2 files contain the code to create the database and you can simply run them on a terminal mysql window.
